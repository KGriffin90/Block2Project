<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Overview:

This is a simple AES encryption and decryption tool written in Java. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using AES-256 encryption. The program generates a new encryption key each time it runs.

<!-- RUNNING THE PROJECT -->
## How to Run Program:

* <ins>compile code</ins>: $ javac AESEncryption.java Test.java
* <ins>run code</ins>: $ java Test

## Dependencies:

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later

<!--LIMITATIONS & ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS-->
## Limitations:

⚠️ This tool is for educational use only. It should not be used for securing sensitive or real-world confidential data. The encryption key is generated dynamically and is not stored, meaning encrypted messages cannot be recovered after the program exits.

## Ethical Considerations:

* This tool is designed to demonstrate encryption concepts and should not be used for malicious purposes.

* Encryption alone does not ensure security—storing and managing keys securely is just as important.

* Users should be aware that this implementation does not handle key persistence, making it impractical for real-world applications without modification.
